# semver-bump

This is a simple module that helps users upgrade a local JSON config file, such as `package.json` to a new version according to [semver](http://semver.org/).

## Installation
```
npm install -g semver-bump
```

## Usage

```
semver-bump ./package.json
```

By default you can leave off `./package.json` and it will look for that file in the current working directory.

Technically this will work on any JSON file that has a `version` property.

## Example output

```
This will bump the version number according to semver
